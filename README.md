# Node.js Mentorship Program

Hi, I'm Guilherme Iscaro.

I'm a software developer from Brazil and I wish to help the Node.JS community by contributing with
code fixes, implementing new features and helping others.

I have experience with open source [contributuions](https://cabelitos.com/contributions), however I would
like to contribute more to the open source software community and Node.JS project itself.

In the future and with the OpenJS Foundation help would love to become a core Node.JS developer and help the community to thrive.

Thank you.
